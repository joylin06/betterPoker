## What is BetterPoker?

Many of our friends play poker, sometimes for money. While this is fun, there are many annoying facets of dealing with at-home poker games, the main ones being that keeping a ledger of how much money an individual owes or gains takes a long time, and all too often it is done at the end of the game. Sometimes people lose track of how many people bought in, and how many buy-ins a certain person had before they left the game. This leads to sometimes having chips go missing and the table doesn’t end up breaking even. Not only this, people hate to be stuck in the lobby of a dorm they do not live in because players are too enthralled by the game to check their phones. Additionally, we often like to retell our poker stories to people who weren’t at the game, but have a hard time recalling the board and our hands. BetterPoker is an embedded system device that aims to resolve these problems to improve the quality of life of dorm-based poker games with the inclusion of features such as:

The ability to let players know that you need to be tapped in
Keeping track of the current pot size
Taking pictures to commemorate your winning hands!
